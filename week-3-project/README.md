the third week's project will be to complete a project from scratch, according to a user-story table [something like this](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-cross-module/tree/master/week-1).  

There will be no starter code, students will be expected to implement (from nothing) a project described in a user-story/architecture table.  They are expected to do so using the module's architecture

students are expected to study their finished projects & the example projects, and make the week 1 starter code work

As students go through the course, different git workflow skills can be overlaid on this basic idea.  ie. in JS 1 they are expected to make a branch per week and merge to master, in JS 2 they are expected to have a branch for each week with sub-branches for each story,  ...

We could also get fancy with branches, having each week's project be on a different one.  This would allow students to collaborate on weekly projects in small groups and turn in one repo for the group.

Linting can be enforced with CI. It's also imaginable that once the projects are well-designed and we're no longer adapting them, they could be graded with an architecture analysis on CI and behavioral tests
