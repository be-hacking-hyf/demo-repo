contains a complete project for students to study
* structured using this module's architecture 
* uses all of this modules learning objective JS features, coding style and techniques
* is accompanied by a user-story table [something like this](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-cross-module/tree/master/week-1), to help students see how it could be developed incrementally - connecting architecture to development cycle


This finished project will in all ways look like what a top student project could be, no more or less advanced.  Students are encouraged to study it, run it, and even to copy-paste & modify from it.  To keep them from being cheatable, the example projects will not have the same behavior (user stories) as the assigned projects.  

Providing these example projects will help students be independant over the week, help them learn organized development to prepare for collaboration, and make it easier for coaches to jump into new modules and grade student projects.
