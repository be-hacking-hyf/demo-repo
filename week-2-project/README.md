the second week's project will be to complete a started project using this module's architecture, according to a user-story table [something like this](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-cross-module/tree/master/week-1).  

The starter code will have carefully chosen bugs (not clearly marked, some throwing errors others not), have missing pieces (with comments indicating what's missing).  While students won't be told where the bugs are, they can be told how many and of what kind

students are expected to go through the starter code, study the example projects, and make the week 2  starter code work

As students go through the course, different git workflow skills can be overlaid on this basic idea.  ie. in JS 1 they are expected to make a branch per week and merge to master, in JS 2 they are expected to have a branch for each week with sub-branches for each story,  ...

We could also get fancy with branches, having each week's project be on a different one.  This would allow students to collaborate on weekly projects in small groups and turn in one repo for the group.

Linting can be enforced with CI. It's also imaginable that once the projects are well-designed and we're no longer adapting them, they could be graded with an architecture analysis on CI and behavioral tests
