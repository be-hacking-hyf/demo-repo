while the projects focus on integrating base coding skills (coding challenges, language features, tdd, dom manipulation & components, ...) in an organized and structured way, the exercises in "assessment" focus on building those base skills in isolation.  students will be expected to complete these exercises individually and submit them by the end of the module.  

this folder will contain coding exercises & tests, and scripts for linting & test running.  Initial grading can be done with continuous integration and repo badges (or github classroom), final grading is done by code-reviews from coaches after tests and linting are green
